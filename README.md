# Movie Recommender System
#### ML Project on Recommender Systems (Without using any special libraries for data science!)

This is my first project on Machine Learning. I used The [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) available publicly. I have used Item Based Collaborative Filtering for this. 

## Overview


I have used 'ML-100k' as my default data set. Also the default test set size is set at 0.1. This can be changed as per need.
On successfully running this system, we get 2 numbers:
- Precision
- Recall

## Want to see this running? 

1. Open your terminal and download: 
> git clone https://github.com/rbajaj1997/Movie_Recommender.git 

2. Run:
> python3 main.py

3. You should see the program running!!
